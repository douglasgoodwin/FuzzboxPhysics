# 90-Second Reports
## Found Oscillation

Tell us, briefly:

- What “buzz / flagging / oscillation” did you find?
- Where did it happen (object + setting)?
- What changed when you moved, touched, or reoriented it?

Time limit: 90 seconds each

---

# What to Listen For

As you share, listen for:

- Thresholds (when it “kicks in”)
- Feedback paths (air, surface, electronics)
- Stability vs drift (steady tone vs wandering)
- Coupling (hand, table, wall, body, room)

---

# Quick Vocabulary
## Oscillation vs Noise

- Oscillation: repeating pattern (often a pitch)
- Noise: broadband, irregular energy
- Many “buzzes” are oscillation plus noise
- The room and surfaces shape both

---

# Next
## A Bridge That Became an Oscillator

We will watch a short video:

Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)

A structure turns wind energy into motion

---

# Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)
## What to Notice

- The bridge “finds” a mode
- Small motion grows into large motion
- The energy input is steady (wind)
- The response is selective (a few strong behaviors)

---

# Key Idea
## Resonance Selects

Systems do not amplify everything

They amplify what they can sustain

Modes win

---

# From Bridges to Rooms

A bridge can “ring” mechanically

A room can “ring” acoustically

Next: a piece built from room resonance

---

# Alvin Lucier (1969)
## I Am Sitting in a Room

A piece that depends on:

- the room’s acoustics
- reverberation
- repeated playback and re-recording

Speech dissolves into the room’s resonant tones

---

# Listening Prompt

While we listen, ask:

- What stays?
- What disappears?
- Which pitches or bands become dominant?
- How long does the room “hold” sound?

---

# Why This Works

Each re-recording:

- reinforces frequencies the room supports
- suppresses frequencies the room does not
- pushes the sound toward the room’s resonances

The room becomes the instrument

---

# Reproducing Lucier Here
## With Smartphones

Goal: repeat playback and recording in the same space

Outcome: the room’s resonances gradually dominate

---

# Lucier Phone Protocol
## Minimal Version

1. Record a 10–20 second spoken phrase
2. Play it out loud in the room
3. Re-record the playback
4. Repeat 10–30 times

Keep the setup consistent

---

# Keep Constant

To make the effect clear:

- same positions for speaker and microphone
- same volume
- same room conditions (doors, bodies, noise)

Small changes change which resonances win

---

# Common Problems

- Clipping (too loud)
- Phone auto-gain “pumping”
- Noise reduction artifacts
- Moving the phone or speaker each generation

Aim for clean, moderate level recordings

---

# If We Have Time
## In-Class Demo

We will try:

- one phrase
- a fixed mic + fixed speaker position
- 5–10 generations, quick listen

Then decide whether to continue next class

---

# Looking Ahead
## LAB02 Preview

Next up: profiling rooms with recordings

Two parts:
1. Consistent source
2. Balloon pop impulse

---

# LAB02
## Room Recording Comparison

Compare how different rooms “sound” by recording:

1. A consistent source
2. A balloon pop impulse

Across three spaces

---

# Why Use a Balloon Pop?

A balloon pop is a quick impulse:

- very short
- very loud
- broadband (many frequencies at once)

After the pop, you mostly hear the room:
reflections, ringing, decay

---

# Room Profiling Idea

Impulse in

Room response out

This is how you capture a room’s “signature”

It is also how very reverberant sites can be characterized
(for example, Hagia Sophia)

---

# Part 1
## Choose Three Spaces

1. Small “dead” room
   closet, carpeted bedroom
2. Medium reverberant
   bathroom, stairwell
3. Large reverberant
   empty classroom, parking garage, church if accessible

---

# Part 1A
## Consistent Source (10–15s)

Pick one and repeat in all spaces:

- steady handclap pattern
- spoken phrase (same sentence)
- sustained sung note
- tapping pattern

---

# Part 1A
## Recording Rules

- phone is fine
- keep distance to source consistent
- keep phone position consistent
- record long enough to capture full decay

---

# Part 1B
## Balloon Pop Impulse (8–15+s)

In each space:

- same position as Part 1A
- same phone height/orientation
- balloon at arm’s length from phone

Do not pop next to the mic

---

# Part 1B
## Procedure Per Space

1. Record 2–3 seconds of silence
2. Pop once
3. Keep recording until decay ends
4. If it clips, redo farther away

---

# Part 2
## Short Observations (Per Space)

3–5 sentences total, covering:

- decay time
- when reflections take over
- what stands out (rumble, ring, flutter echo, pitch)
- what the balloon pop reveals about the room signature

---

# Deliverables

Submit:

- 3 consistent-source files
  dry / medium / wet
- 3 balloon-pop files
  dry-pop / medium-pop / wet-pop
- written observation

---

# Save These Recordings

We will compare them later

Your recordings become reference material
