 # WEEK 5: Pickups and Electromagnetism


**The Guitar is a Sensor**



---

# Pickups Do Not Hear





 - They sense magnetic change





---





---

# String Motion and Flux





 - Vibration modulates magnetic field
 - Voltage is induced





---

# Slide 3. Resonance and Loading**





 - Inductance
 - Capacitance
 - Impedance





---

# Exercises: Listening**


 - Pickup position comparisons
 - Guitar volume knob cleanup


---

# Exercises: Hands-on



 - Load pickup with different impedances
 - Add capacitance and listen

---

# Exercises: Reflection



 - Where does “tone” actually live?

# WEEK 5 – PICKUPS AND ELECTROMAGNETISM

Concept: Guitar as sensor, not microphone

## Cable Capacitance and Loading

---

## Why these matter
	•	Explains resonance, inductance, and loading clearly
	•	Directly supports Brian’s impedance lessons
	•	Critical for understanding why fuzz reacts to guitar volume

## Week 5 hands-on: pickups + loading + buffers

You want two things: a switchable load box and a buffer.

---
## Schematic A: Pickup loading box (switchable resistive + capacitive load)

---
## Circuit
	•	Guitar input tip -> output tip (straight through)
	•	Across tip to GND, add a rotary switch selecting:
	•	R loads: 1 M, 500 k, 220 k, 100 k
	•	Optional caps in parallel: 100 pF, 220 pF, 470 pF, 1 nF

---
## How
	•	Use a 2-pole rotary:
	•	Pole 1 selects resistor to ground
	•	Pole 2 selects capacitor to ground

This lets you hear “cable length” and “amp input impedance” effects instantly.

---
## Schematic B: High-impedance buffer (JFET source follower)

---
## Circuit
	•	Input -> C1 100 nF -> Gate of Q1
	•	R1 1 M Gate to GND
	•	Drain to +9 V directly
	•	Source -> R2 4.7 k to GND
	•	Output from Source -> C2 1 uF -> output jack

---
## Notes
	•	This is the simplest “why buffers matter” demo.
	•	If output is weak, lower R2 to 2.2 k.
