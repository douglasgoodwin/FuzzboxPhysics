# WEEK 2: Broken Gear and Early Amplification

## Failure Becomes Sound

   
---

# Slide 1. Early Amplification Goals

  - Louder
  - Clearer
  - Cleaner

   **Notes:**

   Distortion was *not* the goal.

   

---

# **Slide 2. Why Early Amps Distorted**

   - Low power
   - Limited headroom
   - Inefficient speakers


---


# **Slide 3. Types of Early Distortion**

 - Tube saturation
 - Speaker breakup ("Rumble")
 - Power supply sag


   **Notes:**

   These stack together.

---

# **Slide 4. Accidental Discovery**

   - Musicians liked the sound
   - Engineers tried to avoid it
   - Culture moved faster than design

---

# **Exercises**

   **Listening**

   

   - Early blues and rock recordings
   - Small amp breakup

   

   

   **Hands-on**

   

   - Clean boost into an amp
   - Increase level slowly
   - Listen for compression before breakup

   

   

   **Reflection**

   - Where does “feel” appear?

# WEEK 2 – JFET BOOST / PUSHING AMPS

Concept: Early amplification, headroom, pushing tubes

JFET Booster (Brian-aligned philosophy)
	•	Electra / LPB-style topology (single JFET gain stage)

---
# Good references
	•	https://www.electrosmash.com/lpb-1
Clear explanation of boosting, headroom, and amp interaction.
	•	https://www.runoffgroove.com/fetzer.html
Classic JFET gain stage theory, biasing, and tone implications.

---
# Why this works
	•	Explains why boosting an amp feels different than pedal distortion.
	•	Matches Brian’s gain-stage teaching exactly.

## Week 2 hands-on: clean boost into amp breakup

Schematic: JFET Booster (single stage, classic, great for pushing tubes)

---

## Circuit
	•	Input jack -> C1 100 nF -> Gate (G) of Q1
	•	Gate leak: R1 1 M from Gate to GND
	•	Drain (D) of Q1 -> R2 33 k -> +9 V
	•	Source (S) of Q1 -> R3 1.5 k -> GND
	•	Bypass cap: C2 22 uF from Source to GND (more gain)
	•	Output from Drain -> C3 1 uF -> Volume pot 100 kA (audio)
	•	C3 to pot lug 3
	•	pot lug 1 to GND
	•	output from pot wiper (lug 2) -> output jack tip

---

## Power filtering
	•	+9 V -> R4 100 ohm -> V+ node
	•	C4 47 uF from V+ to GND
	•	Use V+ to feed R2

Parts
	•	Q1: J201 or 2N5457 (JFET)

---

## Notes
	•	This is a “push the amp” circuit. Not meant to distort on its own, but will if the JFET is hot.
	•	If you want more headroom, remove C2 or reduce it to 4.7 uF.
