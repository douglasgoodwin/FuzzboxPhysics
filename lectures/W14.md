# WEEK 14: Capstone Presentations

**From Air to Circuit**

---

# The Full Chain

Over 14 weeks we traced sound from:

1. **Air** — pressure waves, resonance, the body as amplifier
2. **Transduction** — microphones, pickups, converting motion to voltage
3. **Amplification** — gain stages, power amps, headroom
4. **Distortion** — soft clip, hard clip, fuzz, overdrive
5. **Filtering** — tone shaping before and after clipping
6. **Logic** — threshold switching, digital behavior from analog roots
7. **Space** — reverb, reflections, rooms as processors

Your final project should touch at least one of these stages deliberately.

# Presentation Format

Each presentation should include:

- **Demonstrate** — live performance, playback, or documented system
- **Explain** — what does your system do, and where does it break?
- **Connect** — 1–2 sentences linking your project to an earlier lab: "I stole _____ from Week X"

---

# What We're Looking For

- Not polish — **intention**
- Not complexity — **understanding**
- A system that does something you can describe in physical terms
- Bonus: a system that fails interestingly

---

# Questions to Consider

- Where does energy enter your system?
- Where does it saturate, distort, or transform?
- What would happen if you pushed it further?
- What surprised you?

# The Web Labs as Reference

All four web labs remain available for reference and experimentation:

- [Waveform Distortion Lab](https://fuzzbox.cairn.com/fuzzbox-lab.html) — clipping algorithms and harmonics
- [Spectral Sculptor](https://fuzzbox.cairn.com/fuzzbox-sculptor.html) — frequency domain, timbre, formants
- [Digital Octavia](https://fuzzbox.cairn.com/fuzzbox-octavia.html) — signal chain stages of the octave fuzz
- [Reverb Matching Lab](https://fuzzbox.cairn.com/fuzzbox-reverb.html) — room acoustics and impulse responses

# After This Course

You now understand:

- Sound is pressure waves in a medium
- Every device in the chain adds its own nonlinearity
- Distortion is not failure — it's transformation
- The boundary between analog and digital is a clipping threshold
- Circuits are frozen intentions

# Thank You

Go make noise.
