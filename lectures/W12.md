# WEEK 12: Distortion Circuits

**Fuzz vs Overdrive — Designing Nonlinearity**

---

# Two Philosophies

- **Overdrive:** Simulate amp breakup at low volume — soft clipping, dynamic, cleans up with guitar volume
- **Fuzz:** Deliberately obliterate the signal — hard clipping, sustain, compressed

---

# Overdrive Circuit

- Gain stage with diodes in the feedback loop
- Soft clipping — rounds off peaks
- Signal retains dynamics and picking nuance
- Think: tube amp at moderate volume

---

# Fuzz Circuit

- High-gain transistor stages driving into hard clipping
- Two transistors in series: Q1 boosts, Q2 clips
- Diode from collector to base creates feedback clipping
- Cleanup: roll back guitar volume and the fuzz thins out

---

# The Bazz Fuss

- Simplest useful fuzz: one transistor, one diode, a few passives
- Build it, bias it, starve it
- When biased hot: thick, broken
- When starved (low voltage): gated, sputtery
- The "bias" knob = 50k pot in series with collector resistor

---

# Filters Shape Everything

- Same clipping circuit sounds completely different with pre/post EQ
- Bass before clipping → flubby, loose
- Treble before clipping → harsh, cutting
- Bass cut before + bass boost after → tight and heavy (modern metal trick)

---

# Listening

- Jimi Hendrix "Foxy Lady" — fuzz with volume knob cleanup
- Rolling Stones "Satisfaction" — Maestro Fuzz-Tone, one of the first commercial units
- Stevie Ray Vaughan — overdrive (Tube Screamer), dynamics intact
- Compare: Hendrix fuzz vs SRV overdrive on the same riff

**What to listen for:** Cleanup behavior. Sustain character. Does the picking hand still matter?

# Web Lab Connection

- Open the [Waveform Distortion Lab](https://fuzzbox.cairn.com/fuzzbox-lab.html)
- Compare hard clip, soft clip / tanh, asymmetric, and tube algorithms
- Feed in an oscillator and watch the spectrum change as you increase drive
- Notice: hard clip creates odd harmonics, asymmetric creates even + odd

---

# Exercises: Build

- **Individual:** Build both an overdrive and a fuzz on the breadboard
- Compare the same input signal through each
- Try cleaning up with input volume on each — which responds?

---

# Exercises: Reflection

- How does hard clipping start to look like on/off switching?
- What's the boundary between "analog distortion" and "digital behavior"?

---

# Project Proposal Due

- What will you build?
- What sound or behavior are you chasing?
- Where do you expect it to break?
