# **WEEK 7**







## **Filters as Tone Sculptors**





**Distortion Is Shaped**





# **Slide 1. Raw Distortion Is Rare**





- Almost always filtered





---





# **Slide 2. Pre vs Post Filtering**





- Before clipping controls feel
- After clipping controls tone





---





# **Slide 3. Bass Management**





- Tight vs flubby
- Clarity vs mud





---

# Exercises: Listening



- Same distortion with different EQ





---

# Exercises: Hands-on



- RC filter before clipping
- RC filter after clipping


---

# Exercises: Reflection

- Which placement feels better?

## WEEK 7 – FILTERS BEFORE AND AFTER DISTORTION

Concept: Tone shaping as system design

## Pre vs Post Clipping EQ
	•	https://www.runoffgroove.com/eq.html

---
## Why these matter
	•	Demonstrates why bass-before-distortion matters
	•	Reinforces Brian’s filter placement philosophy
	•	Connects directly to “tight vs flubby” feel


---

## Week 7 hands-on: filters before vs after clipping

Use a simple op amp clipper so the only variable is filter placement.

Base distortion core: Op amp hard clipper (to ground)

---

## VB bias
	•	Rb1 100 k from +9 to VB
	•	Rb2 100 k from VB to GND
	•	Cb 47 uF from VB to GND

Input
	•	Input -> C1 100 nF -> op amp (+)
	•	R1 1 M from op amp (+) to VB

---

## Gain stage
	•	Use TL072 (one half) non-inverting:
	•	R2 10 k from op amp (-) to VB
	•	Gain pot: 500 kA as Rf from output to op amp (-)
	•	Wire pot as variable resistor: wiper tied to one outer lug
	•	Gain range: ~1 to ~51 (and more depending pot setting)

---

## Clipping
	•	D1 1N4148 from op amp output to VB (anode at VB, cathode at output)
	•	D2 1N4148 from op amp output to VB (anode at output, cathode at VB)
This gives symmetrical clipping around VB.

---

## Output
	•	Output -> C2 1 uF -> Volume pot 100 kA -> output jack

---

## Now the filters:

---

## Schematic A: Pre-clipping high-pass (tightens bass before distortion)
	•	Place between C1 and op amp (+):
	•	Series cap Cf 22 nF
	•	To VB: Rfilt 100 k
This creates a bass cut into the clipper input.

---

## Schematic B: Post-clipping low-pass (tames fizz after distortion)
	•	After clipping, before C2:
	•	Rtone 4.7 k in series with signal
	•	Ctone 4.7 nF from signal to GND (or to VB if still biased)
This rolls off highs after clipping.

---

## Exercise design
	•	Build the core once.
	•	Put pre-filter and post-filter on a 2-way switch each so you can A/B instantly.
