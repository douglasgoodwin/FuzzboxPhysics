# Fuzzbox Physics Week 01



## **Nonlinearity Before Electronics**

---

# Distortion as Physical Stress


- Distortion Before Electricity
- Nonlinearity as Expression


### Notes:

Set the frame. Distortion is not a mistake. It is what happens when systems are pushed.



---





# Linear vs Nonlinear Systems

- Linear: output scales proportionally
- Nonlinear: output changes character


### Notes:
Explain that distortion is a *behavioral shift*, not a sound effect.

---

# Acoustic Sources of Distortion

- Strings under high tension
- Air columns overblown
- Mechanical limits of materials


### Notes:

Stress creates new harmonics.

---

# Loudness as Energy

- Loud is not just volume
- Loud means more energy in the system


### Notes:

This idea will carry all the way into pedals.

# Exercises: Listening

- Aggressive blues vocals
- Bowed strings played hard
- Brass instruments breaking up

# Exercises: Physical



- Play an acoustic instrument past comfort
- Note when tone roughens



---

# Exercises: Reflection



- When does control give way to expression?
