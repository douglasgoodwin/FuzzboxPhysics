# WEEK 3: Space as Sound Processor

## Reverb Before Circuits

---
# Sound in Space
   - Sound reflects
   - Sound decays
   - Sound spreads

---
# Reverb Is Time

   - Delay
   - Density
   - Energy loss

---
# Rooms as Effects

   - Churches
   - Chambers
   - Halls
   - Stairwells
   - Parking garages
   - 


## Notes

Reverb existed before electronics. Go out and find some!

# Exercises: Listening

  - Dry vs room recordings
  - Natural reverberant spaces

---
# Exercises: Hands-on
  - Record in different rooms
  - Compare early reflections vs tail

---
# Exercises: Reflection
- How does space change emotion?

# WEEK 3 – BUFFERS AND SIGNAL INTEGRITY

Concept: Source loading, impedance, clarity

---

# JFET Buffer
	•	https://www.runoffgroove.com/slug.html
	•	https://www.muzique.com/lab/buffer.htm

Why these matter
	•	Excellent explanation of pickup loading
	•	Directly reinforces Brian’s buffer lessons
	•	Shows why buffers are not “tone suckers” when done correctly

# Week 3 hands-on: space as sound processor

This week is recording-based, but here is a utility circuit that makes the experiments work cleanly.

Schematic: Simple unity buffer for mic/line experiments (op amp follower)

---

## Circuit
	•	Op amp: TL072 (one half)
	•	Non-inverting input (+) -> Input via R1 1 k (optional stopper)
	•	Inverting input (-) tied to output (voltage follower)
	•	Output -> R2 100 ohm -> output jack tip

---

## Bias supply (virtual ground VB = 4.5 V)
	•	R3 100 k from +9 V to VB
	•	R4 100 k from VB to GND
	•	C1 47 uF from VB to GND
	•	C2 100 nF from VB to GND

---

## AC coupling
	•	Input cap: C3 100 nF in series from input jack to op amp (+)
	•	Bias resistor: R5 1 M from op amp (+) to VB
	•	Output cap: C4 1 uF from op amp output to output jack (if you need ground-referenced output)
	•	Output pulldown: R6 100 k from output jack tip to GND

---

## Notes
	•	This lets you record room experiments without loading sources.
	•	You can also use it as the front-end for later weeks.
