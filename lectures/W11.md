# WEEK 11: Amplifier Circuits

**From Voltage to Volume**

---

# Why Amplification Matters

- Everything before this week was signal-level
- Now we push current — enough to move a speaker cone
- Amplification is where "louder" becomes "different"

---

# The LM386: A Tiny Power Amp

- 8-pin chip, runs on 9V
- Gain of 20 (default) to 200 (with cap across pins 1–8)
- Enough to drive a small speaker

---

# Signal Chain So Far

- Pickup / mic → buffer → gain stage → **power amp** → speaker
- Each stage adds its own character
- The LM386 clips differently than a transistor

---

# What Happens at the Edge

- Clean headroom → compression → soft clipping → hard clipping
- **Demonstrate:** Turn up input until the LM386 distorts
- Compare to the [Waveform Distortion Lab](https://fuzzbox.cairn.com/fuzzbox-lab.html): hard clip vs soft clip

# Listening

- Link Wray "Rumble" — amp pushed past its limits as an aesthetic choice
- Little Walter — harmonica mic'd into a guitar amp, distortion as voice extension
- B.B. King — right at the edge of breakup, never quite over
- Hendrix "Voodoo Child" — clean vs overdriven in the same performance

**What to listen for:** The moment when "louder" becomes "different." Headroom exhaustion. Speaker strain.

# Exercises: Build

- **Individual:** Build LM386 amplifier on breadboard
- Input from phone or guitar
- Drive a small speaker
- Add gain cap (10 µF across pins 1–8) and listen to the change
- Push input until clipping begins

---

# Exercises: Observe

- Note the transition from clean to clipped
- How does LM386 clipping compare to the transistor stages you've heard?
- **Key insight:** Hard clipping starts to resemble on/off switching — this is the bridge to digital

---

# Exercises: Reflection

- Where does the amplifier stop being transparent?
- Does clipping here feel different from the fuzz circuits we'll build next week?
