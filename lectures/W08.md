## Why these matter
	•	Shows how logic chips entered music sideways
	•	Explains glitching, squaring, and division clearly
	•	Perfect bridge into digital thinking

## Week 8 hands-on: logic circuits (gate + octave divider)

Schematic A: Comparator noise gate (LM393)

This turns “threshold crossings” into audible gating.

---

## VB bias
	•	Same as above (100 k / 100 k + 47 uF)

---

## Audio path (VCA style on/off using JFET is more complex), so here’s a simple hard gate
	1.	Create a control signal (envelope-ish):

	•	Input -> diode D1 1N4148 -> C1 1 uF to GND (peak hold)
	•	R1 220 k from C1 to GND (release)
	•	This node is ENV

---

## 2.	Comparator:

	•	LM393 powered at +9 and GND
	•	Non-inverting (+) gets ENV
	•	Inverting (-) gets Threshold pot:
	•	100 k pot between VB and GND
	•	wiper to (-)

---

## 3.	Comparator output drives a mute transistor:

	•	LM393 output has pull-up: R2 10 k to +9 V
	•	Output -> R3 10 k -> base of Q1 2N3904
	•	Q1 collector to audio signal node (after a series resistor), emitter to GND
	•	Put R4 1 k in series in the audio path; when Q1 turns on it shunts/mutes through R4

---

## Audio placement
	•	Put mute transistor at the output of a distortion stage for dramatic effect.

---

## Notes
	•	This is not “studio transparent.” It’s intentionally a learnable, obvious gate.

---

## Schematic B: CMOS octave divider (CD4013 flip-flop)

Classic octave-down logic behavior.

---

## Front end
	•	You must feed the 4013 with a square-ish signal:
	•	Use a high-gain transistor squarer:
	•	Input -> 10 nF -> base of Q1 2N3904 via 10 k
	•	Base to GND 100 k
	•	Collector -> 10 k to +9
	•	Take output at collector (square-ish)

---

## 4013 wiring (one flip-flop)
	•	VDD pin 14 to +9
	•	VSS pin 7 to GND
	•	CLOCK to the squarer output
	•	D tied to /Q (so it toggles every clock)
	•	SET and RESET tied to GND
	•	Q output is one octave down (frequency /2)

---

## Output conditioning
	•	Q -> 100 nF -> Volume pot 100 kA -> output
	•	Add 100 k pulldown at output to prevent pops

---

## Notes
	•	This will “glitch” on chords. That’s the point for the lesson.
	•	To clean it up a bit, band-limit the input (single note focus).
