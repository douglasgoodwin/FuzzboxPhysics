# WEEK 13: Logic & Discrete Sound

**When Analog Becomes Digital**

---

# The Bridge

- Last week: hard clipping makes analog signals look like square waves
- This week: circuits that only know ON and OFF
- CMOS logic chips: designed for data, repurposed for sound

---

# CMOS Basics

- CD4069UB: six NOT gates (inverters) on one chip
- Input high → output low. Input low → output high.
- Designed for logic — but if you bias the input at the threshold, it oscillates
- An inverter becomes an oscillator

---

# CD4069 as Distortion

- Feed audio into a biased inverter
- Signal below threshold → output high
- Signal above threshold → output low
- Result: instant square wave — the most extreme clipping possible
- Every waveform becomes a pulse train

---

# CD4069 as Oscillator

- Inverter + RC feedback = square wave oscillator
- Frequency = 1 / (2.2 × R × C)
- Chain multiple inverters for richer textures
- Starve the voltage for unstable, glitchy behavior

---

# Octave Division: CD4013

- D-type flip-flop: output toggles on every clock edge
- Feed in a square wave → get half the frequency (one octave down)
- Chain two for two octaves down
- This is how the Octavia creates sub-octaves

---

# The Octavia Connection

- Open the [Digital Octavia](https://fuzzbox.cairn.com/fuzzbox-octavia.html) web lab
- The rectifier stage uses |x| to double frequency (octave UP)
- The CD4013 divides frequency (octave DOWN)
- Same math, opposite direction

# Listening

- Hendrix "Purple Haze" — octave fuzz (Roger Mayer Octavia)
- Green Ringer octave-up effect
- Sonic Youth — prepared guitar + feedback as gating
- Merzbow, Autechre — noise as material
- Kraftwerk, NES soundtracks — square wave synthesis
- Chiptune, bit-crushed sounds

**What to listen for:** Abrupt on/off behavior. Gating and chatter. Hard digital edges. Threshold-based switching.

# Exercises: Build

- **Demo + optional individual:** CD4069 distortion on breadboard
- Bias an inverter at threshold, feed audio in
- **Optional:** CD4013 octave divider — feed the CD4069 square wave output into the flip-flop
- Articulate what you're hearing

---

# Exercises: Observe

- Compare CD4069 square wave clipping to the transistor fuzz from last week
- What's lost? What's gained?
- Is there any "feel" left, or is the signal fully quantized?

---

# Project Work Begins

- Your CD4069/CD4013 experiments can become project seeds
- Begin integrating earlier techniques (filtering, gain staging, reverb) into your final system
