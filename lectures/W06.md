# WEEK 6: Intentional Distortion


**Transistors, Hendrix, Mayer**



---

# Distortion Becomes Design**





- No longer accidental
- Controlled nonlinearity


---

# Transistor Gain Stages





- Biasing
- Headroom
- Cleanup

---

# Asymmetry and Feel





- Even vs odd harmonics
- Compression behavior

---

# Exercises: Listening**

- Early fuzz tones
- Guitar volume cleanup examples


---

# Exercises: Hands-on


- Single-transistor gain stage
- Adjust bias
- Listen dynamically


---

# Exercises: Reflection



- What feels “alive”?

# WEEK 6 – HENDRIX / MAYER ERA DISTORTION

Concept: Intentional transistor distortion

---
## Fuzz Face (Canonical)
	•	https://www.electrosmash.com/fuzz-face
One of the best fuzz analyses on the web.

---
## Transistor Bias and Cleanup
	•	https://www.muzique.com/lab/fuzzface.htm

---
## Why these matter
	•	Exactly the circuits you are teaching
	•	Explicitly covers cleanup, bias, and feel
	•	Historically accurate to Hendrix-era sounds

## Week 6 hands-on: intentional transistor distortion (fuzz)

---
## Schematic: Bazz Fuss (simple, stable, very “first fuzz build” friendly)

---
## Circuit
	•	Input -> C1 22 nF -> Base of Q1 through R1 100 k (series)
	•	Q1: 2N3904 (NPN)
	•	Base bias: R2 1 M from Base to GND
	•	Emitter to GND
	•	Collector -> R3 10 k -> +9 V
	•	Output from Collector -> C2 100 nF -> Volume pot 100 kA -> output

---
## Clipping
	•	D1: 1N4148 from Collector to Base (anode at Base, cathode at Collector)
	•	D2: 1N4148 from Base to GND (optional for extra gating texture)

---
## Notes
	•	This is “broken gear” sounding when biased hot, and “gated” when starved.
	•	To add a “bias” control: replace R3 10 k with 10 k in series with a 50 k pot (as variable resistor). That becomes your “sag/strain” knob.
