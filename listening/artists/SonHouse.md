## **Son House**





Son House (Edward James House Jr., 1902–1988) was an American Delta blues singer, guitarist, and songwriter. A seminal figure in the development of the Mississippi Delta blues, he shaped the genre’s emotional power through his intense vocals and percussive slide-guitar style, profoundly influencing later icons like Robert Johnson and Muddy Waters.

### **Early life and conversion to blues**





Raised in a devout Baptist household, House began preaching by age fifteen and initially condemned secular music. His attitude changed after hearing bluesman Willie Wilson play slide guitar in the 1920s. Abandoning the pulpit, he brought the fervor of gospel preaching to his blues performances—an intensity that became his hallmark. An early prison term for a shooting, reportedly in self-defense, and itinerant labor shaped his stark, spiritual worldview. 





### **Recording career and Delta collaborations**





In 1930, House recorded for Paramount Records alongside Charley Patton and Willie Brown, creating enduring tracks such as “Preachin’ the Blues” and “My Black Mama.” His 1941–42 field recordings by Alan Lomax for the Library of Congress captured his raw bottleneck style and have since become touchstones of Delta blues authenticity. 





### **Rediscovery and folk revival**





After moving to Rochester, New York, in 1943, House left music for two decades. Rediscovered in 1964 during the folk-blues revival by Dick Waterman and others, he relearned his repertoire with help from Alan Wilson of Canned Heat. His Columbia album *Father of the Folk Blues* (1965) reintroduced his fierce slide guitar and spiritual themes to new audiences, leading to celebrated appearances at the Newport Folk Festival and European tours. 





### **Legacy**





House’s voice—both literal and artistic—bridged the sacred and the profane, shaping the expressive vocabulary of the blues. His rhythmic bottleneck guitar and visceral delivery inspired generations of musicians, from Bonnie Raitt to The White Stripes. Despite retiring in the mid-1970s due to illness, his influence endures as a foundation of modern blues and rock
