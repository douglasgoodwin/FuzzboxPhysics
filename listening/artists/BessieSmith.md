## **Bessie Smith**

Bessie Smith (April 15, 1894–September 26, 1937) was an American blues and jazz singer celebrated as the “Empress of the Blues.” Renowned for her rich contralto voice and commanding stage presence, she became the highest-paid Black entertainer of the 1920s and a defining figure of early recorded blues.

### **Early life and career**

Raised in poverty after being orphaned, Smith began performing as a street singer in Chattanooga with her brother. Around 1912 she joined traveling minstrel shows, mentored by pioneering blues singer Ma Rainey. Her stage experience on the Black vaudeville circuit honed her dynamic performance style. In 1923 she signed with Columbia Records, releasing “Downhearted Blues,” which sold over two million copies and made her a national sensation. 



### **Style and influence**

Smith’s contralto voice projected powerfully even without a microphone, conveying emotional depth in songs of love, hardship, and resilience. She recorded over 160 titles, many with leading jazz musicians such as Louis Armstrong. Her fearless lyrics about female independence and sexuality challenged early-20th-century norms and reflected Black working-class life. 



### **Decline and death**

The Great Depression sharply reduced record sales and curtailed Smith’s recording output after 1933, though she continued to tour and adapt her repertoire toward swing. On September 26, 1937, she died from injuries sustained in a car accident near Clarksdale, Mississippi, at age 43. 



### **Legacy**

Bessie Smith’s influence extends across genres—from Billie Holiday and Aretha Franklin to Janis Joplin, who later helped fund her headstone. Her 1929 film performance in *St. Louis Blues* is preserved in the U.S. Library of Congress National Film Registry, attesting to her enduring role in shaping modern American music.
