## **Rumble**

### **Background and composition**

“Rumble” was inspired by a spontaneous jam at a Washington, D.C., gig when Wray improvised a riff reminiscent of a street fight. The title was suggested by the promoter’s daughter, using 1950s slang for a gang fight. The track’s ominous tone arose from Wray’s use of power chords, deliberate amplifier distortion, and vibrato, creating a menacing atmosphere unusual for the era.



### **Musical innovation and influence**

Wray’s manipulation of amplifier feedback and distortion was groundbreaking; he achieved the fuzzy sound by punching holes in his amplifier’s speaker cone. The piece introduced power chords to mainstream rock, a technique later central to hard rock and heavy metal. Artists from Pete Townshend to Jimmy Page and Iggy Pop cited “Rumble” as a pivotal influence on their guitar style.



### **Controversy and cultural impact**

Despite lacking lyrics, “Rumble” was banned by several U.S. radio stations for allegedly promoting juvenile delinquency due to its raw, threatening sound and title. The controversy only increased its notoriety, and the track became an underground hit, reaching No. 16 on the Billboard chart. Over time, it came to symbolize the rebellious edge of early rock ’n’ roll.



### **Legacy**

“Rumble” has been featured in numerous films, including Pulp Fiction and Independence Day, and was added to the National Recording Registry in 2009 for its cultural significance. It remains one of the most influential instrumentals in rock history, celebrated for introducing distortion as an expressive musical tool.
