## **TOOL 1: Basic Listening Sheet — "First Encounter"**

**Use this for your initial listening to ANY recording featuring vocal or instrumental extremity**

### **Recording Information**
- **Artist/Performer**: ____________________
- **Track Title**: ____________________
- **Year/Context**: ____________________
- **Duration**: ____________________
- **Your listening setup** (headphones/speakers, volume level): ____________________

### **PART A: Immediate Impressions (First Listen)**

**Don't analyze yet — just capture your gut reactions:**

1. **What grabbed your attention first?**
   - [ ] Roughness/distortion in the sound
   - [ ] Physical effort you could hear
   - [ ] Unusual timbres or textures
   - [ ] Moments where something "broke" or failed
   - [ ] Other: ____________________

2. **Emotional/physical response:**
   How did your body react? (Tension, discomfort, excitement, moved?)
   
   ________________________________________________________________

3. **One sentence description:**
   If you had to describe this sound to someone who hasn't heard it:
   
   ________________________________________________________________

### **PART B: Identifying Extremes (Second Listen)**

**Listen again. Mark the timestamp whenever you hear:**

| **Type of Extreme** | **Timestamps** | **Brief Description** |
|---------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **SATURATION** (pushed to maximum volume/intensity) | | |
| **DEPLETION** (running out of breath/energy) | | |
| **INTERFERENCE** (something interrupting the sound) | | |
| **FAILURE** (voice cracks, can't track changes) | | |

### **PART C: The Body Made Audible (Third Listen)**

**What physical processes can you HEAR?**

Check all that apply and note specific moments:

- [ ] **Breath sounds** (inhales, gasps, running out of air)
  - When: ____________  What happens: ____________________

- [ ] **Vocal strain** (roughness, cracking, pushing beyond range)
  - When: ____________  What happens: ____________________

- [ ] **Physical impact** (hitting, percussion on body/instrument)
  - When: ____________  What happens: ____________________

- [ ] **Muscular fatigue** (sound degrading over time)
  - When: ____________  What happens: ____________________

- [ ] **Instability** (pitch wavering, can't hold steady)
  - When: ____________  What happens: ____________________

### **PART D: Reflection**

1. **Is the extremity intentional or accidental?**
   - Intentional (performer chose this sound)
   - Accidental (limitations of the recording/performance)
   - Both/unclear
   
   **Evidence**: ________________________________________________

2. **What does the extremity communicate?**
   (emotion, intensity, authenticity, struggle, power, vulnerability?)
   
   ________________________________________________________________

3. **Could this be performed "cleanly"?**
   - Yes, the performer has the skill but chooses roughness
   - No, this is at the edge of physical capability
   - Unclear
   
   **How do you know?** ________________________________________
