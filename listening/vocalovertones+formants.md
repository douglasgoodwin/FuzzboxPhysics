# Throat Singing as a Physics Demonstration of Harmonics and Formants

---

# Let's:

1. Define pitch (fundamental), harmonics/overtones, and formants (vowel resonances).
2. Explain why overtone singing can sound like “two notes at once.”
3. Use a spectrogram to distinguish: harmonics (fine horizontal lines) vs formant emphasis (broad bright bands).

---

# Vocabulary + the “stack”


- Pitch is the fundamental frequency: what you would hum if you had to “match the note.”
- Most sounds are not a single frequency; they include harmonics (integer multiples of the fundamental).
- Formants are resonant emphasis bands created by the vocal tract. They shape vowels and timbre.

---

# A vertical “frequency stack”

1. A thick line near the bottom labeled “fundamental (pitch).”
2. Three to five thinner lines above it labeled “harmonics.”
3. A fuzzy horizontal “blob” somewhere in the mid-to-upper region labeled “formant emphasis (vowel/timbre filter).”


Pitch is the bottom line. Harmonics are the ladder. Formants are the movable spotlight that makes some rungs brighter than others.

---

# Control example: plain sung note

## Establish a baseline

- Ask one student (or you) to sing a single comfortable note softly on “oo,” then “ah,” keeping pitch as steady as possible.
- Then hum the same note on “mm.”


---

# Discuss:

- “What stayed the same across vowels?” (Pitch)
- “What changed?” (Brightness/timbre; vowel identity)
- “If we recorded this, what would the spectrogram show?” (Same harmonic ladder, different emphasis bands)

# Throat singing is a “two-layer” illusion

## Video 1: Sygyt overtone singing (Huun-Huur-Tu example)

1.	Huun-Huur-Tu, “Sygyt” (clear drone plus whistle overtone)
2.	Sygyt solo performance (good for seeing mouth-shape control)

# listen for two layers:

   - A low drone (fundamental).
   - A high whistle-like line (a single harmonic being strongly emphasized).

---

# How do the layers behave?

- If the singer holds one low pitch, how can the high ‘melody’ move?
- Is the high tone a second source, or a spotlighted harmonic from the same source?

# Formants: the controllable “filter” (vowels, resonance bands)

You now connect what they just heard to vowels and formants.

# Video 2: Formants on spectrogram





Pick one of these, depending on how technical you want to be:



Option A (spectrogram tutorial framing):



- “NCVS Insights: Anatomy of a Spectrogram” 





Option B (explicit formant topic):



- “Spectrogram and Formant | Speech Processing” 
- “Speech Acoustics 5 - vowel formants” 


---

# Key points:

- Harmonics come from the source (vocal folds).
- Formants come from the filter (vocal tract shape).
- Throat singing is extreme filter control: it boosts one harmonic so much that it becomes a second audible pitch.


---

# Spectrogram demo: wide-band vs narrow-band


---

- one recording that is vowel-rich (speech or singing)
- a throat-singing clip.


---

# Instructions

- Wide-band spectrogram (better time resolution): helps you see formants as broader bands that move with vowels.
- Narrow-band spectrogram (better frequency resolution): helps you see harmonics as many thin horizontal lines.

- “Wide-band” often means shorter analysis window.
- “Narrow-band” often means longer analysis window.

---

# Notice

1. On a plain sung vowel: the harmonic ladder is stable, but the bright bands (formants) shift when the vowel changes.
2. On overtone singing: one thin harmonic line becomes unusually bright and can move as the singer changes the filter.

# Video: ringing chord explanation/demonstration

“Barbershop Theory #2 How To Ring A Chord” 

- Barbershop: multiple voices align tuning and vowels so overtones reinforce.
- Throat singing: one voice uses the vocal tract filter to spotlight a harmonic.

---

# Selective reinforcement in the harmonic spectrum.


---

# Wrap: the three-part model

1. Source = fundamental + harmonic ladder
2. Filter = formants (vowel/timbre envelope)
3. Perception trick = when one harmonic becomes loud enough to be heard as a separate tone


---

# In one sentence: how can one voice sound like two notes?



---

# try it!

- Everyone hums a comfortable note on “mm.”
- Slowly open to “oo,” then sweep “oo → oh → ah → eh → ee,” keeping pitch steady.

Where does the sound feel brightest? Where does it feel darkest?
