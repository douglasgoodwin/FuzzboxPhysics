## Overview

In this lab you will build sounds from silence by painting directly into a spectrogram — the visual representation of a sound's frequency content over time. You will construct harmonic series by hand, discover why a clarinet sounds different from an oboe, take apart a vowel to find out what timbre actually is, and attempt to repaint your own voice from scratch.

Use Chrome or Firefox. You will need working speakers or headphones. A mouse is helpful but not required — the Rake tool makes trackpad use practical.

## What to Do

Follow the five-part exercise on the instruction page linked above. Each part walks you through specific steps. Read the "listen for this" notes carefully — they tell you what to pay attention to.

**Part 1 — The Harmonic Series by Hand** (4 pts)
Build a sawtooth wave by painting harmonics one at a time at 220 Hz. Then compare to the Rake tool version.

**Part 2 — What Makes a Clarinet?** (4 pts)
Use the Rake with ODD ONLY to hear how missing even harmonics change timbre.

**Part 3 — Destroy and Discover** (4 pts)
Take apart a vowel sound. Erase the formants, erase everything but the fundamental, erase the fundamental itself.

**Part 4 — Spectral Self-Portrait** (4 pts)
Record your voice, study it, then try to recreate it by painting from silence.

**Part 5 — Spectral Score** (4 pts, bonus)
Draw anything on the spectrogram and listen to what it sounds like. Compose a 2-second sound that evokes a place, an event, or a creature.

## What to Turn In

Five screenshots with short written responses. Label each one clearly.

| # | Screenshot | Written Response |
|---|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Your hand-painted 8-harmonic spectrogram | — |
| 2 | Your odd-harmonics-only spectrogram | 1 sentence: how does removing the even harmonics change the sound? |
| 3 | The vowel with its fundamental erased | 1 sentence: why can you still hear the pitch? |
| 4a | Your recorded voice spectrogram | Label your fundamental frequency |
| 4b | Your painted voice recreation | 2–3 sentences: what was hardest to recreate? What does that tell you about human voice? |
| 5 | Your spectral score (bonus) | Give it a title and one sentence describing what you were trying to evoke |

## Concepts You Should Understand After This Lab

- The **harmonic series**: pitched sounds are stacks of sine waves at integer multiples of a fundamental
- **Timbre** is determined by which harmonics are present and how loud each one is
- **Odd vs. even harmonics**: cylindrical bores (clarinet) cancel evens; conical bores (oboe) keep them
- **Formants**: resonant frequency bands shaped by the mouth and throat that define vowel sounds
- **The missing fundamental**: your brain reconstructs pitch from the harmonic series even when the fundamental is absent
- A **spectrogram** is a complete representation of any sound: frequency × time × amplitude

## Grading

This is a participation and exploration lab. There are no wrong sounds. Full credit for completing all five parts with thoughtful written responses that demonstrate you engaged with the material. The bonus part (Part 5) can earn up to 4 extra points.
