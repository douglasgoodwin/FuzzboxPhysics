## The Physics of Audio Distortion (Analog and Electronic)

**Course Description**

A hands-on exploration of sound amplification and distortion. Through this course, students will understand the relationship between human perception and acoustic media. The course explores acoustic instruments and the human voice, amplification, and how stereo systems at home and in vehicles changed music and made distortion into an aesthetic. We will start by studying resonance and how bodies and acoustic instruments amplify sound. We will consider different strategies for amplification in air, wood, tubes, and solid-state electronics. Students will experiment with harmonic frequencies and signal transmission in various media and consider how these physical effects are represented by amplification. We will turn to electronics and the kinds of distortion that they introduce, especially the differences in distortion produced by vacuum tubes and solid-state electronics. We will consider the relationship between distortion produced by vacuum tubes, solid-state electronics, and digital effects. We will also study vinyl records, microphones, and guitar pickups to see what they capture and how they render sound waves into electricity. We will explore the differences between mechanical, magnetic, and piezo-electric listening devices and the signature sound of each approach.

**Course Arc**

This course traces the path from physical energy (air, motion, vibration) to electronic behavior (amplification, distortion, logic). By Week 13, you will have built systems across this entire chain. Your final project will intentionally push one of these systems past its limits. Start noticing now where things break.

## Project Requirements

### Week 12 — Project Proposal

**Due:** End of Week 12  
**Length:** ~1 paragraph (5–7 sentences)

Your proposal should answer:

- What will you build or demonstrate?
- What sound or behavior are you chasing?
- Which techniques from the course will you combine? (e.g. acoustic resonance, transduction, amplification, filtering, distortion, logic)
- Where does energy enter the system?
- Where do you expect it to saturate, distort, or fail?

You may frame the project as:

- a functional device
- a sound study
- or a deliberately unstable system

Clarity of intention matters more than polish. **You are encouraged to propose systems that might fail interestingly.**

### Week 14 — Final Project Presentation

The final project should demonstrate an understanding of **at least one stage** of the path from physical energy (air, motion, vibration) to electronic behavior (amplification, distortion, logic). Projects may take the form of an instrument, sound piece, or documented system pushed to its limits.

**Presentation requirements:**

- Demonstrate your project (live performance, recording, or documentation)
- Include 1-2 sentences explicitly connecting your project to one earlier lab: **What did you steal from Week X? How did that earlier experiment inform your final system?**

---

## Assessment

Weekly labs are assessed on **completion, documentation, and your ability to articulate what you observed.**

Individual vs. collaborative work:

- **Individual builds:** Weeks 5, 6, 8, 11, 12 (critical skill development)
- **Pairs/groups:** Weeks 7, 9 (more complex assemblies)
- **Demo + optional:** Weeks 10, 13 (conceptual exploration)

Does this capture everything? The listening assignments are now integrated with specific "what to listen for" prompts, and all the labs reflect the final versions we developed together.
