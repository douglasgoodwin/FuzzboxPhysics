# Introduction and Listening Session

## Welcome and Course Philosophy

Welcome to Fuzzbox Physics! I'm Doug Goodwin, and I want to start by saying: I really love teaching here at CalArts because of you. I've taught at many places over the years—Scripps College for six years, UCLA's Design Media Arts program where I currently teach—but there's something special about CalArts students. The conversations here are unusual and memorable, and I hope we have many of those this semester.

I also teach in the Film/Video and Experimental Animation programs here, including a new class called "Vibecoding." The idea behind Vibecoding is to use AI to write code for you that can make artwork, putting AI to work as a programmer rather than as an artist. I mention this because it connects to our explorations in this class about using technology in unexpected ways.

## About This Course

This class is about sound and distortion—specifically, how we can really dig into these phenomena. What is distortion? What does it look like and sound like? How can you make it? Most of the work happens in class. I do assign readings, and it's great if you do them, but I'd much rather you spend your time digging into the way Bessie Smith sings, or Nina Hagen, or Son House. We'll be listening to people who use their voices and bodies to generate distortion, to change sound and make it into something different.

When most people think about distortion, they think about electronics or digital processing—guitar pedals, Neil Young plugging straight into the amplifier. And yes, we will build electronic devices by the end of the semester. You'll be working with breadboards, components, making actual distortion circuits. But I really think understanding distortion starts with the body and our awareness of how we shape sound and create artifacts from our physical selves.

## My Background

I've had an eclectic path to this work. I studied physics in undergrad, but I was actually a theater major (and chemistry minor). I ran a theater for a while, though I don't do theater anymore. When I was in high school, I had a company making loudspeakers and crossover networks. I got access to wealthy people's homes and made speakers for them—speakers taller than I was. Looking back, they probably weren't the best speakers in the world, but it got me into shaping signal and thinking about how amplified sound is its own thing. It's not just about making voices louder for a stadium; it's about changing sound in particular ways so that it becomes something new.

I remember talking to Morton Subotnick, who still teaches here occasionally, about how he realized he was really composing for car radio or hi-fi systems, and how that changed his approach to composition. If you listen to pop music or any recorded music, it doesn't resemble acoustic music, usually. It's something else entirely.

My dad was a musician who put himself through school playing jazz. He saw Billie Holiday sing, which made a big impression on him. He also yelled at me through five years of piano lessons—maybe that's why I went toward the physics side. I don't play piano anymore, though I wish I had kept it up.

## The Fundamentals: Acoustics in Five Minutes

Let me speak briefly about acoustics—everything you need to know in five minutes. We exist in a medium we call air. Air can conduct sound because it can be compressed readily. When I speak, something inside my body produces resonance, which gets amplified by my chest. From my theater training, I learned how to resonate different parts of my body to produce different effects.

These pressure waves in the air reach your bodies, your ears, and move parts of your body in particular ways. Your brain interprets those vibrations as sound, as music. There's a lot happening here: resonance, pressure waves, perception. It's more than just eardrums moving and the tiny bones in your ears (the smallest bones in your body) vibrating. There's also the cochlea, which looks like a little snail shell and can do FFTs (Fast Fourier Transforms) on the fly. Your cochlea can do math! Pretty amazing, right?

The eardrum is a tiny diaphragm, a piece of skin. Sometimes people's eardrums burst from infections, but they can grow back. There's also a tube (the Eustachian tube) that can equalize pressure—you experience this on airplanes or driving up into the mountains when your ears pop.

Think about air pressure this way: imagine a column of air sitting on top of you right now, going all the way up into space where it dissipates. Gravity holds the air down, creating atmospheric pressure. This is the medium we're working with. To conduct sound, you need some kind of medium that can be pressurized.

## Interlude: John Cage's 4'33"

Before we get into the listening portion of class, I want to show you a performance of John Cage's 4'33". [We watched a video performance of the piece]

**Class Discussion After 4'33":**

The responses were fascinating. Several students noted how the page turns and other incidental sounds became amplified—more noticeable than they would normally be. One student felt an ongoing anticipation throughout, engaging with the piece in a different way, always listening for whether it was about to begin.

We discussed boredom—whether 4 minutes and 33 seconds of silence is a scary concept given our shortened attention spans. One student noted that experimental film classes had prepared them for this, making the time feel like nothing at all. We talked about whether it's good for us to just sit and be present without distraction, and how the page turns functioned as cues to help people stay oriented in time.

This piece connects to what we're doing because it makes us aware of all the sounds that exist even in "silence"—the noise floor of any environment. John Cage famously visited an anechoic chamber at Harvard (a room with foam pyramids on every surface to absorb all sound) and reported hearing two things: his blood circulating and his nervous system operating. The piece challenges us to consider: what is music? What counts as sound worth attending to?

## Course Structure and Rhythm

Here's how this class works: We meet once a week. I'll talk for 40 minutes to an hour, then we take a break. After the break, we do listening together. Sometimes I'll send you out to document things in the field.

**The rhythm is this:** We work together in class—listening, discussing, reflecting on what we hear. There are also labs where you'll go out and document things in the world, mostly during class time. You'll upload reflections on what you've listened to and produce certain things during the labs.

Most everything that's "homework" is due the same day we work on it or before the next class. For instance, today we're listening to recordings together, and your notes are due today. If you can't be here for some reason, get the recordings and upload your notes anyway. These are reflections, not high-stakes assignments.

## The Listening Assignment

Today you'll work in pairs (or small groups of no more than four) to analyze recordings using the worksheet I'm handing out. One sheet per group is fine. We're going to listen to several tracks—mostly really old recordings—and I want you to put yourself back in the room with the recording artist. Think about the conditions under which the music was made: Maybe they were drinking. Maybe there was somebody in the room with them, maybe not. Maybe one microphone for several musicians. Think about how they worked with that medium.

**What to listen for:**

First, capture your initial impressions:

- What grabs your attention first?
- Is it roughness? Physical effort?
- Are there unusual textures?
- Are there moments where the voice fails?
- How does your body react?
- What's your emotional response?

Then, on subsequent listens, try to identify:

- **Saturation**: When is the voice or recording equipment being pushed really hard? Is it overdriven, distorted?
- **Depletion**: Is the person running out of breath? How does the tone change?
- **Interference**: Is something interrupting the sound? Voice cracks? Other failures?
- **Physical markers**: Do you hear breath sounds, vocal strain, physical impact, muscular fatigue, instability?

And ask:

- Is it intentional or accidental?
- What does it communicate?
- What would happen if you tried to do this cleanly?

## The Field Lab Assignment

For next week, you'll complete a field lab on your own (or in pairs if you prefer). The task: go out and find physical systems that resonate. Document them—tap on things, find flags in the wind, record your own voice, whatever you discover. I want you to find resonance in various places. Take notes. Challenge yourself to find things you wouldn't normally think of.

This is due before class next time. You'll need to document:

- What is it? Where did you find it?
- How is energy getting into it?
- Is there a trigger that causes the resonance?
- What's keeping it from continuing forever?

This isn't about getting it "right"—it's about observing. And hang onto your recordings, because we'll use them later in the semester when we build reverb tanks and compare acoustic resonance to electronic processing.

## The Artists We're Listening To Today

We listened to or discussed:

- **Son House** - "Death Letter Blues" (1965), "Grinnin' in Your Face" (1930): The essential example of vocal strain, voice breaking as proof of authenticity
- **Bessie Smith** - "St. Louis Blues" (1925), "Empty Bed Blues" (1928): Controlled approach to the edge, extreme breath management
- **Skip James** - "Devil Got My Woman": Extreme high tenor, strain in maintaining pitch
- **Mahalia Jackson** - "Take My Hand, Precious Lord": Gospel shout, spiritual possession made audible
- **Muddy Waters** - "Mannish Boy": Making the body audible as machine
- **Howlin' Wolf** - "Smokestack Lightning": Using entire chest cavity as resonating chamber, intentional roughness
- **Nina Hagen** - "Naturtrane": Classically trained opera singer deliberately violating technique, scream-to-coloratura transitions
- **Patti Smith** - "Land": Hits her chest while singing, creating interference with her own breath

## Looking Ahead

The course modules will cover:

- **Fundamentals**: Resonance, strain, stress, space as sound processor
- **Transduction**: Listening to noise vs. signal, making microphones (crystal microphone, piezo contact mic)
- **Distortion and Loudness**: Building loudspeakers, guitar pickups, analog sound effects
- **Sustained Oscillation**: Victorian synthesizer (making oscillators from junk)
- **Digital Electronics Tortured into Distortion**: Using electronics to create synthetic distortion

By the end of the semester, you'll be building circuits, making your own transducers, and understanding how physical systems relate to electronic ones.

**For next class:** Upload your listening notes and complete the resonance field documentation. All recordings are available on Canvas.

See you next week!
