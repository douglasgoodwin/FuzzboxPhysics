| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Nonlinearity before electronics      | [**Son House**](SonHouse.md) – vocal strain and rasp [**Bessie Smith**](BessieSmith.md) – pushing air limitsSolo cello or violin recordings – bow pressure distortion | Play acoustic instrument beyond “clean”. Identify where tone roughens. | Conceptual foundation for gain and clipping.   | https://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/music/                  |
| 2        | Broken gear & early amplification    | [**Rumble**](Rumble.md) – amp and speaker strain as attitudeEarly Chicago blues guitar recordings – compression before breakup | JFET boost into amp. Push until compression appears before distortion. | Gain stages, headroom, saturation vs clipping. | https://www.electrosmash.com/lpb-1                   |
| 3        | Space as sound processor             | Early gospel recordings in churches – long decayChamber reverb recordings from 1940s studios | Record dry vs reverberant rooms. Compare reflections vs tail. | Signal flow intuition (no circuit overlap).    | https://sound-au.com/articles/reverb.htm             |
| 4        | Mechanical reverb                    | [**Dick Dale**](DickDale.md) – spring reverb splashEarly dub recordings – exaggerated space | Build spring driver + recovery. Compare to room reverb.      | Reinforces gain recovery and filtering.        | https://sound-au.com/articles/spring-reverb.htm      |
| 5        | Pickups & electromagnetism           | Clean electric guitar recordings with volume knob usePickup position comparisons on same guitar | Pickup load box + JFET buffer. Compare loading before vs after buffer. | Input impedance, buffers, pickup interaction.  | https://www.sound-au.com/articles/guitar-pickups.htm |
| 6        | Intentional distortion (Hendrix era) | **Revisit: “Rumble”** – what is missing compared to fuzz? [**Jimi Hendrix**](JimiHendrix.md) – cleanup, sustain, control | Build and bias two-transistor fuzz. Explore cleanup with guitar volume. | Core material: biasing, gain, clipping, feel.  | https://www.electrosmash.com/fuzz-face               |
| 7        | Filters shape distortion             | Same distortion with different EQ curvesMid-focused vs bass-heavy distortion tones | Add pre- and post-clipping filters. Compare tight vs flubby bass. | Passive tone shaping, filter placement.        | https://www.muzique.com/lab/tone3.htm                |
| 8        | Logic & discrete sound               | Early octave fuzz tonesIndustrial and glitch textures with abrupt gating | CD4069 distortion and CD4013 octave divider. Observe glitching. | Outside scope (intentional expansion).         | https://www.lookmumnocomputer.com/cmos-music         |
| 9        | Pedals as historical artifacts       | Compare fuzz, overdrive, and hard digital distortionIdentify “physical” vs “mechanical” feel | Analyze a pedal schematic as a historical document.          | Schematic reading, block analysis.             | https://www.runoffgroove.com/technical.html          |
| 10       | Capstone: from air to circuit        | Student-selected reference that inspired final build         | Build a pedal combining buffer, filtering, distortion, logic. | Full synthesis of Brian’s course.              | https://www.muzique.com/lab/main.htm                 |
